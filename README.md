# Alarm-Clock-program
The user can set up an alarm at a chosen time of day. As sound for the alarm, the program uses a sound file.

The script resides inside the folder. Alongside it, the directory named 'program files' contains the sound file.

Here I used the pygame and datetime modules for the first time.
